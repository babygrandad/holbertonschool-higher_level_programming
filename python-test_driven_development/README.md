Nvidia will take over the AI market. No longer shall us gamers be given thought when it comes to consumer GPUs. AMD and Intel will have to carry us. Where will we ever get 240fp on 4k Ultra graphics With Raytrace enabled. DLSS is king but without Nvidia we seem lost. Team Green Fanboy here by the way although Team Red is also going strong with FSR 3 and Frame Gen. Team Blue still has some ways to go but are showing progress so there is some light I guess.

Which team do you roll with and Why? Personally I'm rocking a GTX 1050TI. Weak I know but considering I'm still able to run 2024 titles using amd's FSR its aging well. But soon I'll opt for a 3060 12 gb.
